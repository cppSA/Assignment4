# Assignment4
In this repository you will find 4 files regarding the fourth exercise given in CPP course.
The first - main.cpp - was given to us - and as you can see it stayed unchanged.
The second - CircularInt.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our program.
The third - CircularInt.hpp - is the header file with everything needed for our code to work.
The fourth-MyTest.cpp-is the unit test to test the performance of our program.
All three files were compiled and tested using the main.
Please note the documentation throughout the code.
